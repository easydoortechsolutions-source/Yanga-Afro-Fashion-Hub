# Core Assumptions

These assumptions drive all design decisions.

1. Buyers will not trust African fashion sellers without escrow.
2. Vendors will join if payments are reliable and they get demand.
3. Diaspora buyers will pay higher prices for reliability.
4. Quality control will be social + dispute-based, not warehouse-based (for now).
5. Speed of launch matters more than feature completeness.
6. Yanggah must look and feel more premium than Jumia or Instagram sellers.
7. The MVP must work in Nigeria before it works globally.
