# Yanggah – Roadmap

## Philosophy
Yanggah will be built in **phases of validation**, not phases of engineering.

Every phase must prove:
- Buyers trust the platform
- Vendors get paid
- Transactions complete

Nothing else matters.

---

## Phase 0 – Foundation (now)
Goal: Make the company buildable.

Deliverables:
- Vision
- Product definition
- Architecture
- Data model
- Payments & escrow logic
- GitHub foundation

Success:
- Yanggah has a clear, frozen blueprint.

---

## Phase 1 – MVP (Trust Loop)
Goal: One buyer, one vendor, one successful escrowed transaction.

Deliverables:
- User auth (buyer, vendor, admin)
- Vendor application + approval
- Product upload + listing
- Checkout
- Payment held in escrow
- Order state tracking
- Delivery confirmation
- Admin dispute resolution
- Release or refund

Success:
- Real money moves
- Real product is delivered
- No chaos

---

## Phase 2 – Stability
Goal: 50–100 successful transactions without breaking.

Deliverables:
- Better admin tools
- Order dashboards
- Dispute evidence uploads
- Vendor performance visibility
- Basic analytics

Success:
- Yanggah can run without constant manual panic.

---

## Phase 3 – Growth
Goal: Make the marketplace grow itself.

Deliverables:
- Vendor onboarding flow
- Buyer reviews
- Vendor ratings
- Email + WhatsApp notifications
- Simple referral loops

Success:
- Transactions grow without founder involvement.

---

## Phase 4 – Infrastructure
Goal: Reduce friction and increase trust.

Deliverables:
- Logistics integrations
- Auto-release after delivery
- Payout automation
- Vendor working capital (later)

Success:
- Yanggah feels like a real commerce platform, not a startup.

---

## Phase 5 – Expansion
Goal: Own African fashion commerce.

Deliverables:
- New African markets
- New fashion categories
- Financing
- Cross-border fulfillment

Success:
- Yanggah becomes the default platform for African fashion globally.

---

## What we explicitly will not do early
- Custom tailoring systems
- Warehouses
- Influencer social networks
- AI fashion tools
- Complex subscriptions

Those come after trust and money flow are proven.
