# Yanggah – Vision

Yanga exists to become the digital home of African fashion, starting with Nigerian traditional wear.

The problem:
African fashion is fragmented, offline, untrusted, and invisible to the global market. Buyers — especially in the diaspora — struggle with fraud, inconsistent quality, poor logistics, and zero accountability. Vendors struggle with payments, exposure, and trust.

The opportunity:
Africa has world-class fashion talent, but no world-class marketplace built specifically for it.

Yanga will be the trusted marketplace where:
- Designers and vendors sell safely
- Buyers purchase with confidence
- Payments are protected
- Quality is visible
- African fashion scales globally

We are not building a generic e-commerce site.
We are building the **infrastructure layer for African fashion commerce**.

Yanga starts with:
Nigerian traditional wear (agbada, aso-ebi, kaftans, bridal, cultural pieces)

Yanga expands into:
Pan-African fashion, logistics, financing, and cross-border trade.

Success means:
When anyone anywhere thinks “African fashion”, they think “Yanga”.
