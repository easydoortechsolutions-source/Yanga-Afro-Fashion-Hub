# Yanggah-Afro-Fashion-Hub
# Yanga – Foundation

This repository contains the **foundational documents** for Yanga, a marketplace for African fashion starting with Nigerian traditional wear.

It is not a codebase.

It is the **source of truth** for:
- Product vision
- Business assumptions
- System architecture
- Data model
- Payments and escrow logic
- Roadmap

All engineering, design, and AI-assisted development for Yanga must follow what is defined here.

## What Yanga is

Yanga is building the **trusted commerce infrastructure for African fashion**.

The MVP is a marketplace where:
- Verified vendors sell Nigerian traditional fashion
- Buyers (local and diaspora) purchase with confidence
- Payments are held in escrow
- Quality is enforced through disputes and admin moderation

We are not building a generic store.
We are building the **trust layer** for African fashion.
